# Viriback to MISP

This project aims to get the detection generated for the project (C2 Tracker)[https://tracker.viriback.com/], and create events in MISP. 

The events will be distributed by month/year and malware family, like the example below. In each event will be created objects for each IOC detected in the C2 Tracker.
